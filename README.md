# Amina's programming journey
This repo is my professional project management tool. Here I am including my 2019 goals, what I hope to achieve in my current sprint and what I have achieved in previous ones.

## 2019 goals
My goals have changed significantly over the course of the year. After accepting my first developer job at the Guardian in August, my goals are:
* Learn how to manage my imposter syndrome so that I can be an effective Associate Software Engineer at the Guardian
* Teach myself basic vanilla Javascript over August and September
* Read the first 3 chapters of the Programming in Scala Book
* Attend a scala meetup and the Lambdale conference.

I started 2019 with the following goals:
* independently build Rails CRUD apps using TDD
* confidently build React CRUD apps using TDD
* Use and create RESTful APIs 
* build and manipulate databases
* Use agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

# July to September 2019
* Exercism Javascript - 30mins a day
* JS30 start
* Scala Hello World
* Attend Lambdale conference on Functional Programming (21 September)
* Setup Raspberry Pi Zero
