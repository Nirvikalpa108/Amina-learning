# Amina's programming journey
I am teaching myself how to code and am using this repo as my project management tool. Here I am including my goals for my current sprint and what I achieved in previous sprints.

## Overall by the end of 2019, I hope to have:
* Led my development team to implement best practices relevant for our work and team (pair programming, code reviews, implement continuous integration, use of open source where possible, git culture - branches and commit message practices, test driven development)
* Use TDD for all code I write
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Know basic Ruby on Rails and React
* Practice Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

## Already evidenced and continuing to work on (as of March 2019):
* Put code into production in a commercial setting
* Practice pair programming
* Undergo code reviews
* Use Agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)
* Know basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Use RESTful APIs 
* Know how to build and manipulate Databases

# Sprint 3 - April to June 2019
## Goals

* Solve one issue per week on the [Layers of London repo](https://github.com/layersoflondon/application) in my dayjob (1 hour pairing, x hours preparing)
* Spend four hours per week on the [Ruby for Good Diaperbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper) and [Partnerbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/partner) repos; 2 hours pairing and 2 hours preparing for my pairing session
* Create the [branch-it.cook](https://github.com/Nirvikalpa108/Rails-blog) Rails CRUD app (one hour pairing session with Thoughtbot, three hours preparing)

* Learn how to write unit and integration tests in Rails
* Write one [blog post](https://medium.com/@adewusi) per week on something I've learnt
* Prepare [Brighton Ruby conference](https://brightonruby.com) talk
* Prepare [Hamburg Ruby unconference](https://rubyunconf.eu) talk

## Method

Every **Tuesday**:
* Choose LoL issue to work on, check it's relevant with my colleagues, assign myself, describe how I would solve by responding on the issue, get feedback from colleagues on my proposed solution - implement during the week.
* Choose Diaperbase issue to work on, ask Chase for a time to pair with him, ask for preparatory reading links - do reading  during the week.
* Sign up for Thoughtbot Friday office hour, decide new CRUD app feature to work on, ask Rob on Slack for advice on my proposed solution and any reading - create pull request during the week, ask for Rob's review and note any questions for TB office hour.
* Decide topic of blog post - set aside 2-4 hours during the week to write.

By **15 April**:
* Complete this [Rails testing tutorial](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails).

By **22 April**:
* Ask @Torgo to help me prepare my conference talks, propose milestones for my preparation and get his feedback

On **27 April**:
* Attend [Linux virtual machine workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Linuxing-In-London/events/255908624/).

# Previous sprints
* Sprint 1 - Q4-18 Started learning how to code, completed code first girls beginners course, secured a junior dev job.
* Sprint 2 - Q1-19 Started my first dev job; re-negotiated my role, found a Rails open source project to contribute to (Diaperbase), found mentors to help me with building Rails CRUD apps (ThoughtBot) and got my first tech conference talk accepted (Brighton Ruby, July 2019).
