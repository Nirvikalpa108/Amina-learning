# Amina's programming journey
This repo is my professional project management tool. Here I am including my 2019 goals, what I hope to achieve in my current sprint and what I have achieved in previous ones.

## Overall by the end of 2019, I hope to have:
* Led my development team to implement best practices relevant for our work and team (pair programming, code reviews, implement continuous integration, use of open source where possible, git culture - branches and commit message practices, test driven development)
* Working knowledge of React
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

## Already evidenced and continuing to work on (as of March 2019):
* Know basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Working knowledge of Ruby on Rails
* Put code into production in a commercial setting
* Use TDD
* Undergo code reviews
* Use RESTful APIs 
* Know how to build and manipulate Databases
* Practice pair programming
* Use Agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)
