# Amina's programming journey
This repo is my professional project management tool. Here I am including my 2019 goals, what I hope to achieve in my current sprint and what I have achieved in previous ones.

## Overall by the end of 2019, I hope to:
* independently build Rails CRUD apps using TDD
* confidently build React CRUD apps using TDD
* Use and create RESTful APIs 
* build and manipulate databases
* Use agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

# Sprint 3 - April to June 2019
## Goals

* **LoL** - Solve one issue per week on the [Layers of London repo](https://github.com/layersoflondon/application)
* **Diaperbase** - Solve one issue per week on the [Ruby for Good Diaperbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper) and [Partnerbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/partner) repos
* **CRUD app** -Create the [branch-it.cook](https://github.com/Nirvikalpa108/Rails-blog) Rails CRUD app using TDD. Create one small feature per week.
* **Other** - Write one [blog post](https://medium.com/@adewusi) a month on my journey. Prepare my conference talks for [Brighton Ruby conference](https://brightonruby.com) and the [Hamburg Ruby unconference](https://rubyunconf.eu).
