# Amina's programming journey
This repo is my professional project management tool. Here I am including my 2019 goals, what I hope to achieve in my current sprint and what I have achieved in previous ones.

## Overall by the end of 2019, I hope to:
* independently build Rails CRUD apps using TDD
* confidently build React CRUD apps using TDD
* Use and create RESTful APIs 
* build and manipulate databases
* Use agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

# July to September 2019
