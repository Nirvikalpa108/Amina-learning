# Amina's programming journey
This repo is my professional project management tool. Here I am including my 2019 goals, what I hope to achieve in my current sprint and what I have achieved in previous ones.

## Overall by the end of 2019, I hope to have:
* Led my development team to implement best practices relevant for our work and team (pair programming, code reviews, implement continuous integration, use of open source where possible, git culture - branches and commit message practices, test driven development)
* Know basic Ruby on Rails and React
* Use TDD for all code I write
* Write clear and concise technical documentation
* Practice Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
* Have an understanding of the following considerations; security, availability, reliability, monitoring integration, performance testing and scalability

## Already evidenced and continuing to work on (as of March 2019):
* Know basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Put code into production in a commercial setting
* Undergo code reviews
* Use RESTful APIs 
* Know how to build and manipulate Databases
* Practice pair programming
* Use Agile processes (user stories, stand-ups, sprints, retros)

# Sprint 3 - April to June 2019
## Goals

* Solve one issue per week on the [Layers of London repo](https://github.com/layersoflondon/application) in my dayjob (1 hour pairing, x hours preparing)
* Spend four hours per week on the [Ruby for Good Diaperbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/diaper) and [Partnerbase](https://github.com/rubyforgood/partner) repos; 2 hours pairing and 2 hours preparing for my pairing session
* Create the [branch-it.cook](https://github.com/Nirvikalpa108/Rails-blog) Rails CRUD app (one hour pairing session with Thoughtbot, three hours preparing)

* Learn how to write unit and integration tests in Rails
* Write one [blog post](https://medium.com/@adewusi) per week on something I've learnt
* Prepare [Brighton Ruby conference](https://brightonruby.com) talk
* Prepare [Hamburg Ruby unconference](https://rubyunconf.eu) talk

## Method

Every **Tuesday**:
* Choose LoL issue to work on, check it's relevant with my colleagues, assign myself, describe how I would solve by responding on the issue, get feedback from colleagues on my proposed solution - implement during the week.
* Choose Diaperbase issue to work on, ask Chase for a time to pair with him, ask for preparatory reading links - do reading  during the week.
* Sign up for Thoughtbot Friday office hour, decide new CRUD app feature to work on, ask Rob on Slack for advice on my proposed solution and any reading - create pull request during the week, ask for Rob's review and note any questions for TB office hour.
* Decide topic of blog post - set aside 2-4 hours during the week to write.

**Weekly structure**:
* Tuesday - plan and structure the week & blog
* Wed - LoL
* Thu - CRUD app
* Fri - Diaperbase

By **15 April** complete this [Rails testing tutorial](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/test-driven-rails).

By **22 April** ask @Torgo to help me prepare my conference talks, propose milestones for my preparation and get his feedback

On **27 April** attend [Linux virtual machine workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Linuxing-In-London/events/255908624/).
